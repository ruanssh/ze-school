# Description

This project is a school management application developed in Python, using Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Abstraction. The core of the application is a Flask-based REST API, allowing for the registration of students, teachers, and subjects.

Furthermore, user interfaces were implemented using React JS and the Ant Design (antd) framework, providing a user-friendly and intuitive experience.
